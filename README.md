# Eastvantage – Data Engineer Assignment

This repo contains **two complete solutions** that compute the total quantity of each item purchased per customer (ages 18–35) from the provided SQLite database and outputs a semicolon-delimited CSV with integer quantities.

## Files
- `Data Engineer - Assignment Database.db` — the original SQLite DB (place in repo root).
- `solution_sql.py` — pure-SQL approach using `sqlite3` and one query.
- `solution_pandas.py` — Pandas-based approach.
- `output_sql.csv` — sample output generated by `solution_sql.py`.
- `output_pandas.csv` — sample output generated by `solution_pandas.py`.

## Output format
CSV (semicolon `;` delimiter) with the following header:

```
Customer;Age;Item;Quantity
```

Rows include only `Quantity > 0` and ages between 18 and 35 inclusive.

## How to run

### 1) Pure SQL
```bash
python solution_sql.py "Data Engineer - Assignment Database.db" "output_sql.csv"
```

### 2) Pandas
```bash
python solution_pandas.py "Data Engineer - Assignment Database.db" "output_pandas.csv"
```

Both scripts will:
- connect to the SQLite database
- compute totals per customer & item within the age band
- drop zero-total rows
- write a semicolon-delimited CSV with integer quantities

## Test
Both implementations produce identical outputs for the provided database.
